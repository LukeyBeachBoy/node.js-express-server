# node.js-express-server

## What is it?
This is a server created using Express and Node.js. I created this in order to learn the fundamentals of servers in Express, and how to use Handlebars template engine in order to inject dynamic content into the html.

## Functionality
It serves a simple website with various pages. As seen in the source code, some of the text rendered on the site is injected through the template engine rather than static. This was a taster for learning how to create dynamic pages which lead me to learn Angular.
